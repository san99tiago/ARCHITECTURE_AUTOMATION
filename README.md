# AUTOMATION OF EXCEL SHEETS FOR ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS :house:

This project is an old version of a simple automation implementation that generates a organized Excel file with the important information
of a small architecture business. The first old project was based in a simple ".txt" file that saved the information, but now I'm working
to organize it better and achieve a MySQL database managment system. < br/>

At this stage, it's still in development. < br/>

For more information, you can contact me.

## Primary Dependencies
*Tkinter <br/>
The GUI interface is develped with this simple, but powerfull library.

*TTK <br/>
Allows us to add extra styling features to the GUI done in Tkinter.

*Xlsxwritter <br/>
This is the main tool that allows us to manipulate and create the Excel sheets for the important information acquired and processed 
with the main GUI app.
