# AUTOMATIZACIÓN DE PROYECTOS EN EMPRESA DE ARQUITECTURA :house:

This project is an old version of a simple automation implementation that generates a organized Excel file with the important information
of a small architecture business. The first old project was based in a simple ".txt" file that saved the information, but now I'm working
to organize it better and achieve a MySQL database managment system. < br/>

At this stage, it's still in development. < br/>

For more information, you can contact me.
